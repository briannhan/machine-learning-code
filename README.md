# Data cleaning and analysis for UCI NATURE wildlife photos machine learning models
 This was all of the code I've written and all the files I produced for as a research technician under UCI NATURE where I performed data cleaning and analysis of wildlife photos taken from UCI NATURE's field cameras. The purpose of my job was to clean and analyzed data to help refine machine learning models that would be used to identify animal species in photos taken by UCI NATURE's field cameras. This was a very interesting and informative experience. Hopefully I'll remember this down the line.

All of this was written in the tf-gpu environment that I created on Anaconda.
